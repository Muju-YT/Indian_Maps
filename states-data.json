The demand intensified following the death of Potti Sriramulu, who died fasting for this cause. Later, in 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, Andhra merged with the Telangana region (which was part of Hyderabad State) to form a united Andhra Pradesh. However, after prolonged agitation, Telangana was separated in 2014, making Andhra Pradesh a reorganized state. It now plans Visakhapatnam as its executive capital.",

After decades of protests, Telangana was officially formed on June 2, 2014, as India’s 29th state (later 28th after J&K split).

            "history": "Goa, located on the western coast of India, has a rich and unique history influenced by centuries of foreign rule. Originally part of the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BCE, Goa later came under the rule of the Kadambas, Chalukyas, and Yadavas. In 1510, the Portuguese, led by Afonso de Albuquerque, captured Goa from the Sultan of Bijapur and established it as the capital of Portuguese India. For over 450 years, Goa remained a Portuguese colony, making it the longest-held European colony in India. This colonial legacy deeply influenced Goa's architecture, religion (predominantly Catholicism), language, and culture. After India's independence in 1947, Portugal refused to hand over Goa. In response, India launched Operation Vijay on December 18, 1961, and liberated Goa, along with Daman and Diu, on December 19, 1961. Initially made a Union Territory, Goa was later granted statehood on May 30, 1987, becoming India’s 25th state. Today, Goa is known for its beautiful beaches, world heritage churches, vibrant festivals, and a unique blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures.",
