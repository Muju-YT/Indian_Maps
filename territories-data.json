      "history": "Jammu and Kashmir was a princely state that acceded to India in October 1947 under Maharaja Hari Singh following a tribal invasion from Pakistan. It enjoyed special autonomy under Article 370, which was abrogated on August 5, 2019, leading to the bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories—Jammu and Kashmir (with a legislative assembly) and Ladakh (without legislature). Since October 31, 2019, Jammu and Kashmir has been under the direct administration of the Central Government, with provisions for holding elections to enable local governance.",
