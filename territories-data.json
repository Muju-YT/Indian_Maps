These islands were historically used as penal settlements by the British, the most infamous being Cellular Jail (Kala Pani) in Port Blair. During World War II, the islands were occupied by the Japanese and were briefly administered by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in 1943 under the Azad Hind Government. After independence, the islands became a Union Territory in 1956. Today, they are a strategic military location and a hub for eco-tourism and marine biodiversity.",

These regions, despite their geographical separation and distinct cultural influences, were merged on January 26, 2020, to improve administrative efficiency. The Union Territory retains a strong Portuguese colonial legacy, visible in its architecture, churches, language influence, and traditional festivals.",
